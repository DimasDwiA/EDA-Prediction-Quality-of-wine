# EDA-Prediction-Quality-of-wine
## Introduction
Wine is the result of fermenting fruits, such as red grapes, that have been crushed. The alcohol content in wine generally ranges from 12â€“15%. This type of alcoholic beverage is known to be high in antioxidants so it is believed to provide health benefits. as in the data we have there are several compositions from making wine with different qualities, in the dataset if the quality is low like the number 0 in the quality of the dataset it means that the quality possessed by the wine is not so good, the higher the quality number in the wine then the better. The quality of wine depends on the composition, the higher the levels of alcohol, sulphates and citric acid, the better the quality of the wine. for the portfolio that I made, it will create machine learning to predict the quality of a wine drink with input from the composition of the wine.
